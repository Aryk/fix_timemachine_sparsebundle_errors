Fix Time Machine Sparse Bundle Errors
===================================

A little script I wrote to fix the Time Machine sparsebundle NAS based backup 
errors. It follows this tutorial:

http://www.garth.org/archives/2011,08,27,169,fix-time-machine-sparsebundle-nas-based-backup-errors.html

In order to run this, the script file must be executable and you must have Ruby installed:

<pre>
sudo chmod 777 fix_sparse_bundle.rb
</pre>

Then, you run it with:

<pre>
./fix_sparse_bundle.rb
</pre>
